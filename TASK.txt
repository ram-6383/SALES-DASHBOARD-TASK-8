📊 Insights from Task 3: Sales Data Visualization & Storytelling
1️⃣ Top Products & Revenue Contribution

Certain products (like Laptops and Smartphones) contribute the highest revenue share, despite having lower sales volume.

Accessories (like Headphones, Desk Lamps) sell in higher quantities but contribute less revenue → indicates low-margin, high-volume products.

2️⃣ Customer Segmentation

High-spending customers are clustered in the 30–40 age group.

Male customers spend slightly more on electronics, while female customers are more evenly distributed across categories.

This segmentation suggests opportunities for targeted marketing.

3️⃣ Sales Trends Over Time

Peak sales occur in Q4 (October–December) → festive/holiday season effect.

Mid-year dips (June–July) suggest promotional campaigns could help maintain sales momentum.

4️⃣ Regional / City Performance (if region data was present in your dashboard)

Certain cities/countries contribute majority of sales, highlighting key markets.

Regions with lower sales may require localized campaigns.

5️⃣ Profitability & Product Mix

High-ticket items (Laptops, Smartphones) → drive revenue but may need discounts for bulk sales.

Low-ticket items (Headphones, Lamps) → add-ons / impulse buys that increase order value → great for cross-selling.

6️⃣ Customer Behavior

Returning customers contribute a significant portion of sales → indicates loyalty.

First-time buyers spend less per order → targeted onboarding offers can increase their average spend.

✅ Summary of Key Business Takeaways:

Focus marketing on high-spending age groups (30–40).

Bundle low-ticket items with premium products to increase order value.

Plan campaigns in mid-year to balance seasonal dips.
